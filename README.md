## Introduction & Goals

I am a software engineer on a mission to become a proficient AI Engineer as well. My goals include:
- Mastering the core concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
- Building and deploying AI-driven projects.
- Documenting my journey and learnings to serve as a resource for others.
- Ultimately launching my own venture centered around AI products.

## Roadmap

My journey is structured in phases:
1. **Phase 1: Foundations (Completed)**
   - Mathematics for AI, Python programming, data handling: [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science).
2. **Phase 2: Core Machine Learning Concepts (Current Focus)**
   - Enrolled in courses such as *[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)*.
   - Developing introductory ML projects.
3. **Phase 3: Deep Learning & Advanced Topics**
   - Diving into neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and advanced architectures.
4. **Phase 4: Productization**
   - Building production-ready AI applications.

## Projects

All projects are organized in the `/projects` directory. Each project folder contains:
- **README.md:** Description, setup instructions, and progress notes.
- **Source Code:** Scripts, notebooks, and experiment files.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations, challenges, and key learnings.

## Notes & Documentation

I maintain detailed notes and course summaries in the `/notes` directory. This includes:
- Course modules and lecture notes.
- Summaries of research papers and blog posts.
- Reflections on experiments and project outcomes.

## Resources & Courses

Key courses and resources that guide my learning:
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization**
- **Machine Learning by Andrew Ng**
- **Deep Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng)**
- **AI For Everyone**

Additional readings and online articles are referenced within the project and notes folders for deeper insights.

## Progress Updates

I update this repository regularly with:
- **Changelog:** A log of milestones, major project updates, and key achievements.
- **Weekly Reflections:** Brief summaries of new concepts learned and challenges overcome.

## How to Contribute
